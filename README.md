## Overview
Buzztraq is a health and fitness app that tracks calorie consumption and warns the user when they have reached or exceeded their recommended limits. This project gave me the opportunity to explore the broad scope of front end UI/UX development through the production of a landing page for a fictitious business. From conceptualizing the mock company, to performing industry research, image editing in Adobe Illustrator, and coding, Buzztraq was my introduction to a bigger world of front end development.

## Research
One of the tasks of this project required doing market research on a problem that needs to be solved or an existing app that can be improved. Calorie trackers are all the rage, so why not add a feature that will physically notify the user when they’ve eaten too much? This lead to the creation of personas that would represent the target audience so that I could tailor the product to their needs.

<h1 align="center"> App Design </h1>

## Watch Interface

### Ideation
A body worn device was needed to record and display user data, so a smart watch was the obvious choice for this task. Completing the personas was immensely helpful in this phase as it highlighted that the information needed for the user to successfully engage with the product had to be clear, concise, and easy to navigate. Hand drawn mockups were made with those 3 points in mind.

  </p>

### Wireframes

#### Low fidelity
Moving from hand drawn wireframes to mockups in Adobe XD allowed me to hone in on the aesthetic and minimalist design.  The interface was kept clean with only relevant information displayed. Dot navigation was added for easy switching between infographic screens.

</p>

#### High fidelity
In the high fidelity mockup, to assist with visibility of system status, a simple color scheme was chosen to keep the user informed as data changed.  The designs for the watch faces were created in Adobe Illustrator, with the animated screen being rendered in Adobe After Effects.

  </p>

## Phone Interface

### Ideation
To accompany the main functions of the app on smart watches, I set out to create an interface for mobile devices that would allow the user to sync data, see progress at a glance, share achievements and engage with others in the BuzzTraq community.  

### Wireframes

#### Low fidelity

The primary data that coming from the smart watch needed to be up front and easy to read, so the natural place for it on the mobile app was in a 3 tile section near the top of the viewport.  I also wanted to include cards that with secondary infomation including a weekly view of calories consumed, an acheivement section to boost morale and encourage use of the app, and a feature section that could include articles of interest to the user.

</p>

#### High fidelity

The hi fidelity mockup of the phone app stayed close to the lo-fi mockup with a few small adjustments.  The titles for the sections were taken out of the card for better readability, tooltips and links were also added for a smoother experience navigating and understanding the features of the app.

<h1 align="center"> Landing Page Design </h1>

## Overview

### Ideation
To draw the user in I thought it would be important to create a landing page and sign up form for the company.  This would include muliple CTAs and a simple aesthetic to keep the user focused and interested in the product.

### Wireframes

#### Low fidelity
The mobile first design is intended to keep the tone light, with plenty of white space for the images and text to breathe.

</p>

#### High fidelity
For the high fidelty I chose a color pallete with light and dark blue shades, and a zig zag pattern in the layout to keep the eyes moving down the page in a smooth flow.

</p>

<br>

## Prototype
The landing page was built using React, vanilla javascript, and SCSS with a mobile first responsive design.  Images were created in Adobe Illustrator, After Effects and compressed for optimization. It adheres to the themes of the app with logos and CTAs in appropriate areas and includes a standard contact form that is consistent with the average user’s experience on other products.
